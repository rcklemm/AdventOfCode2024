# AdventOfCode2024

Not sure if I'll be consistent about it this year. The repo is mostly here so I can easily work on it across devices.

Followed this [guide](https://ocaml.org/docs/installing-ocaml), then installed the JaneStreet core library with `$ opam install core`

Also added `eval $(opam env)` to my `~/.bashrc` so all the commands are on `PATH` in every new shell

Eventually I might learn to use a build system, for now I'm just manually compiling everything and adding a Makefile
